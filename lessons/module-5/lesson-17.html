                    <h2>Introduction: From Guesswork to a Business</h2>
                    <p>So far, you've learned how to analyze the market and manage your risk. But how do you combine all of this into a consistent process? The answer is with two essential documents: your <strong>Trading Plan</strong> and your <strong>Trading Journal</strong>. These tools are what transform trading from a hobby into a structured business.</p>

                    <h3>The Trading Plan: Your Professional Rulebook</h3>
                    <p>A trading plan is a written set of rules that defines every aspect of your trading. It is your personal business plan, designed to remove emotion and guesswork from your decisions. You create the plan when you are calm and analytical, and your only job when the market is open is to <strong>execute the plan flawlessly</strong>.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                       <p><strong>Analogy: A Pilot's Flight Plan.</strong> A pilot would never take off without knowing their destination, their exact route, and their emergency procedures. Your trading plan is your flight plan. You should never enter a trade without it.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Core Components of a Trading Plan</h4>
                    <p>Your plan must answer these questions with absolute clarity:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What currency pairs will I trade?</li>
                        <li>What timeframes will I analyze?</li>
                        <li>What is my exact entry setup?</li>
                        <li>What is my exit strategy (for both wins and losses)?</li>
                        <li>What is my risk management rule (e.g., the 1-2% rule)?</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>The Trading Journal: Your Feedback Loop for Improvement</h3>
                    <p>If the trading plan is your rulebook, the trading journal is your performance review. It's where you record every trade you take to track your progress, identify patterns, and learn from your mistakes.</p>
                     <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Analogy: A Pro Athlete's Game Tape.</strong> A professional football player reviews recordings of their games to see what they did right and what they did wrong. Your trading journal is your game tape. It provides the honest feedback you need to improve.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>What to Record for Every Trade</h4>
                    <p>For every single trade, you should log:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Date, Time, and Currency Pair</li>
                        <li>Your Entry, Stop Loss, and Take Profit prices</li>
                        <li>The final Profit or Loss</li>
                        <li><strong>Most Importantly:</strong> A screenshot of the chart and a note on <strong>why</strong> you took the trade and how you were feeling.</li>
                    </ul>
