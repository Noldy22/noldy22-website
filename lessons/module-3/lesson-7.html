                    <h2>Introduction: The Story of Price</h2>
                    <p>A price chart is the trader's most important tool. It tells the story of the battle between buyers and sellers over a period of time. While there are different types of charts (like line and bar charts), the vast majority of professional traders use <strong>Japanese Candlesticks</strong> because they provide the most information in a single glance.</p>

                    <h2>The Four Key Prices (OHLC)</h2>
                    <p>Every single candlestick on a chart represents a specific period of time (e.g., one hour, one day) and shows you four crucial pieces of data from that period:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Open:</strong> The price at the very beginning of the period.</li>
                        <li><strong>High:</strong> The absolute highest price reached during the period.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low:</strong> The absolute lowest price reached during the period.</li>
                        <li><strong>Close:</strong> The price at the very end of the period.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>The Anatomy of a Candlestick</h2>
                    <p>A candlestick has two main parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Body (the thick part):</strong> This represents the range between the Open and the Close price.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Wicks (or Shadows - the thin lines):</strong> These show the full range of price movement, from the High to the Low.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Bullish vs. Bearish Candlesticks</h3>
                    <p>The color of the candle's body tells you the most important part of the story: which side won the battle in that period.</p>
                     <div class="example-box">
                        <p>A <strong>Bullish Candle</strong> (usually green or white) forms when the <strong>Close price is higher than the Open price</strong>. This tells us that during this period, buyers were in control and pushed the price up.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>Bearish Candle</strong> (usually red or black) forms when the <strong>Close price is lower than the Open price</strong>. This tells us that sellers were in control and pushed the price down.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Putting it Together: The Story of a Single Candle</h2>
                    <p><strong>Vivid Example:</strong> Imagine you are looking at a <strong>1-hour bullish candle</strong>. The body tells you the price ended the hour higher than it started. If it has a long wick on top, it means that at some point, buyers pushed the price very high, but sellers fought back and pushed it down a bit before the hour closed. The candle doesn't just show that price went up; it shows the <em>story</em> of the fight to get there.</p>
