                    <h2>Introduction: The Market's Fingerprint</h2>
                    <p>If candlesticks are the words, then market structure is the language. Market structure is the directional flow of price over timeâ€”it's the market's fingerprint, showing us where it has been and where it is likely to go. Understanding structure is the first step to building any trading strategy.</p>

                    <h2>The Three Market Directions</h2>
                    <p>At any given time, the market can only be doing one of three things:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Moving Up (an <strong>Uptrend</strong>)</li>
                        <li>Moving Down (a <strong>Downtrend</strong>)</li>
                        <li>Moving Sideways (a <strong>Consolidation</strong> or <strong>Range</strong>)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Our job as traders is to identify the current direction and trade with it.</p>

                    <h3>The Uptrend (A Bullish Market)</h3>
                    <p>An uptrend is a clear sign that buyers are in control. It's defined as a series of <strong>Higher Highs (HH)</strong> and <strong>Higher Lows (HL)</strong>.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                       <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of it like climbing a staircase. You take a step up (a new high), then take a small step back onto a higher stair (a higher low), and then continue climbing. As long as you don't step back down lower than your previous step, you are still climbing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The Downtrend (A Bearish Market)</h3>
                    <p>A downtrend is a clear sign that sellers are in control. It's defined as a series of <strong>Lower Highs (LH)</strong> and <strong>Lower Lows (LL)</strong>.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like walking down a staircase. You take a step down (a new low), then a small step back up to a lower stair (a lower high), and then continue descending. As long as you don't step back up higher than your previous step, you are still going down.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Consolidation (A Sideways Market)</h3>
                    <p>A consolidating market is a sign of indecision. The price is not making clear higher highs or lower lows. Instead, it is bouncing between a high price (resistance) and a low price (support). During this phase, neither buyers nor sellers are in clear control.</p>

                    <h2>The #1 Rule: "The Trend is Your Friend"</h2>
                    <p>This is one of the most famous sayings in trading, and for good reason. The highest probability trades are made when you trade <em>in the direction</em> of the main trend. In a clear uptrend, you should primarily be looking for opportunities to buy. In a clear downtrend, you should primarily be looking for opportunities to sell.</p>
