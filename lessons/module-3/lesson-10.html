                    <h2>Introduction: The Trader's Dashboard</h2>
                    <p>A technical indicator is a mathematical calculation based on a currency pair's price or volume. The result is plotted as a line or a graph on your chart to provide extra information.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Analogy: A Car's Dashboard.</strong> Think of indicators like the dashboard in your car. The speedometer and fuel gauge give you useful information, but they don't drive the car for you. The <strong>price chart is the road ahead</strong>. You must always watch the road (price action and market structure) first, and only glance at your dashboard (indicators) for confirmation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Two Main Types of Indicators</h2>
                    <p>While there are thousands of indicators, they mostly fall into two categories.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Trend-Following Indicators</h3>
                    <p>As the name suggests, these indicators are designed to help you identify and confirm the direction of the market's trend. The most common type is the <strong>Moving Average (MA)</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> A Moving Average takes the average closing price over a set number of periods (e.g., the last 50 hours) and plots it as a smooth line on your chart.</p>
                    <p><strong>How traders use it:</strong> A simple rule of thumb is that when the price is consistently trading <strong>above</strong> the moving average, the market is considered to be in an uptrend. When the price is <strong>below</strong> it, the market is in a downtrend.</p>

                    <h3>2. Oscillators</h3>
                    <p>Oscillators are indicators that move back and forth between two extremes, and they are designed to measure momentum. The most popular oscillator is the <strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> The RSI is displayed in a separate window below your chart and measures momentum on a scale of 0 to 100.</p>
                    <p><strong>How traders use it:</strong> A reading <strong>above 70</strong> is considered <strong>"overbought"</strong>, suggesting that buying momentum is high and the market might be due for a pullback. A reading <strong>below 30</strong> is considered <strong>"oversold"</strong>, suggesting that selling momentum is high and the market might be due for a bounce.</p>

                    <h2>The Power of "Confluence"</h2>
                    <p>The real power of indicators comes when you combine them with your knowledge of market structure. This is called <strong>confluence</strong>â€”when multiple, independent signals all point to the same conclusion.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Vivid Example:</strong> Imagine the price of EUR/USD comes down to a strong <strong>support level</strong> (from Lesson 9). At the same time, you look at your RSI and see that it is in the <strong>"oversold"</strong> zone. This confluence of two different signals gives you a much higher-probability reason to look for a buying opportunity.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The #1 Trap: Analysis Paralysis</h2>
                    <p>The biggest mistake beginners make is adding too many indicators to their chart. A chart with 5 or 10 different indicators will give you conflicting signals and lead to confusion, not clarity. This is called "analysis paralysis." It's best to pick one or two and learn them well.</p>
