                    <h2>Introduction: Beyond Support and Resistance</h2>
                    <p>In Module 3, we learned about Support and Resistance as lines where price reacts. Supply and Demand is a more advanced way of looking at these areas. We focus on the <strong>zones</strong> where a massive imbalance between buyers and sellers caused a strong, explosive price move.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                       <p><strong>Analogy: Line in the Sand vs. A Deep River.</strong> Think of basic Support and Resistance as a <strong>line in the sand</strong>. Think of Supply and Demand zones as a <strong>deep, wide river</strong>. Price might dip into the river (enter the zone), but it's much harder to cross. These are stronger areas.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Demand Zones (Where Institutions Bought)</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>Demand Zone</strong> is a price area where a sharp, explosive upward move began. This indicates that institutional buying pressure was so immense that it overwhelmed all the sellers, leaving a footprint of many unfilled buy orders behind.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>How to Identify It:</strong> Look for a small area of consolidation or a few small candles that occurred right before a very large, powerful bullish (green) candle. That small area is your Demand Zone.</li>
                        <li><strong>How Traders Use It:</strong> When price returns to this zone, traders anticipate that the remaining buy orders will be triggered, causing the price to rally again.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Supply Zones (Where Institutions Sold)</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>Supply Zone</strong> is the opposite. It's a price area where a sharp, explosive downward move began, indicating overwhelming selling pressure.</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>How to Identify It:</strong> Look for a small area of consolidation right before a very large, powerful bearish (red) candle. That area is your Supply Zone.</li>
                        <li><strong>How Traders Use It:</strong> When price returns to this zone, traders expect the unfilled sell orders to be triggered, causing the price to drop again.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Why is this "Advanced"?</h2>
                    <p>The strength of a zone is determined by the <strong>speed</strong> at which price leaves it. A slow move away from an area means it's a weak zone. A fast, explosive, and imbalanced move away tells you that a major institution was involved, making it a very strong and high-probability zone to watch.</p>
