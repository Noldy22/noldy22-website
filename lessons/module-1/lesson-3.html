                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The forex market is not one single entity. It's a complex ecosystem of different players, from giant banks to individual traders like us, all interacting for different reasons. Understanding who is participating in the market and when they are most active is key to understanding why prices move the way they do.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Forex "Food Chain": A Market Hierarchy</h2>
                    <p>Think of the market as a pyramid. At the top are the players with the most money and influence, and at the bottom are the smallest.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The Giants - Central Banks & Governments:</strong> These are the apex players (like the U.S. Federal Reserve or the Bank of Tanzania). Their goal isn't to make a profit. Instead, they participate to manage their country's currency and control inflation. Their actions, like changing interest rates, can cause massive waves across the market.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Backbone - Major Commercial Banks:</strong> These large banks (e.g., Barclays, JPMorgan) form the "interbank market," where the vast majority of trading happens. They trade for their large corporate clients and for their own accounts.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Big Movers - Corporations & Investment Funds:</strong> A large company like Toyota needs to convert the US Dollars it earns from sales back into Japanese Yen. Large investment funds speculate on currency movements to generate returns for their clients.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Challengers - Retail Traders:</strong> This is us! We are individuals trading our own capital through an online broker.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>The 24-Hour Market: Trading Sessions</h2>
                    <p>Because the market is global, it's open 24 hours a day, five days a week. It follows the sun around the globe, opening in each major financial center as their business day begins. The day is broken into four major trading sessions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sydney Session:</strong> The first to open for the week, generally quiet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tokyo Session:</strong> The main session for Asian markets.</li>
                        <li><strong>London Session:</strong> The largest and most important session, with the highest volume.</li>
                        <li><strong>New York Session:</strong> The main session for the Americas.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The "Golden Hours": Session Overlaps</h3>
                    <p>The most important times of the trading day are when two major sessions overlap. This is when trading volume is at its highest, often leading to the biggest price moves.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Vivid Example: The London-New York Overlap.</strong> For a few hours each day (around 3 PM to 7 PM your time in Dar es Salaam), both London and New York are open for business. This is when the most economic news is released and when the majority of institutional trading takes place. For most traders, this overlap period offers the highest probability of finding significant trading opportunities.</p>
