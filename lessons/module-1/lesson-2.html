                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Every professional field has its own language, and trading is no different. To read a chart or discuss a trade, you need to know the basic vocabulary. This lesson will teach you the essential terms that form the foundation of all forex trading. We will explain each concept slowly and with clear examples.</p>
                    
                    <h2>1. Currency Pairs: The Trading "Teams"</h2>
                    <p>In forex, you are never just buying "the Euro" or selling "the Dollar." You are always exchanging one currency for another. Think of it like a sports match: one team plays against another. In forex, one currency is always priced against another. This is called a <strong>currency pair</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The first currency in the pair is the <strong>Base Currency</strong>, and the second is the <strong>Quote Currency</strong>.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Vivid Example:</strong> Let's look at the most traded pair in the world: <strong>EUR/USD</strong>.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>EUR</strong> is the Base Currency. It's the "one" you are buying or selling.</li>
                            <li><strong>USD</strong> is the Quote Currency. It's the price you pay, or receive, for the base currency.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the price of EUR/USD is <strong>1.0750</strong>, it means it costs <strong>$1.0750 US Dollars</strong> to buy <strong>â‚¬1 Euro</strong>.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>2. Pip: The Unit of Measurement</h2>
                    <p>A "pip" is the basic unit of measurement for a currency pair, like a "point" in a game. It's the smallest standard price move.</p>
                    <p>For most currency pairs, a pip is the <strong>fourth decimal place (0.0001)</strong>.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                         <p><strong>Vivid Example:</strong> If the price of EUR/USD moves from <strong>1.0750</strong> to <strong>1.0751</strong>, it has moved up by <strong>1 pip</strong>. If it moves from <strong>1.0750</strong> to <strong>1.0800</strong>, it has moved up by <strong>50 pips</strong>.</p>
                         <p>(Note: For pairs involving the Japanese Yen, like USD/JPY, a pip is the second decimal place, e.g., 145.5<strong>0</strong>).</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>3. Lot Size: The Volume of Your Trade</h2>
                    <p>A "lot" refers to the size, or volume, of your trade. Think of ordering coffee: you can get a small, medium, or large. In forex, the most common "sizes" are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Micro Lot:</strong> 1,000 units of the base currency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mini Lot:</strong> 10,000 units.</li>
                        <li><strong>Standard Lot:</strong> 100,000 units.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Vivid Example:</strong> The lot size you choose determines how much money a 1-pip move is worth.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you trade 1 <strong>Micro Lot</strong> of EUR/USD, a 10-pip move might be worth <strong>$1</strong>.</li>
                            <li>If you trade 1 <strong>Mini Lot</strong>, that same 10-pip move is worth <strong>$10</strong>.</li>
                            <li>If you trade 1 <strong>Standard Lot</strong>, that same 10-pip move is worth <strong>$100</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                         <p>Your lot size is the primary way you control your risk, which we will cover in great detail later.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>4. Leverage & Margin: The Double-Edged Sword</h2>
                    <p>This is a crucial concept that allows retail traders to participate in the market.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> This is a tool provided by your broker that allows you to control a large amount of money using a small amount of your own. It's expressed as a ratio, like 100:1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Margin:</strong> This is the small amount of your own money you put up as a "good faith deposit" to open a leveraged trade.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Vivid Analogy:</strong> Think of leverage like a loan from a bank to buy a house. You might put down a 10% deposit (your margin) to buy a house worth 10 times that amount.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vivid Example:</strong> You have a <strong>$1,000</strong> trading account and your broker offers <strong>100:1 leverage</strong>. This means you can control a position size of up to <strong>$100,000</strong> ($1,000 x 100).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Good:</strong> If you open a $100,000 position and the market moves 1% in your favor, you make a $1,000 profit, doubling your account.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Bad:</strong> If the market moves 1% against you, you have a $1,000 loss, which is your entire account.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Leverage magnifies both your potential profits and your potential losses. It must be used with extreme caution and excellent risk management.</p>
