                    <h2>Introduction: Proving Your Edge</h2>
                    <p>You have learned the concepts and built a trading plan. But how do you know if your strategy actually works without risking real money? The answer is <strong>backtesting</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Backtesting is the process of manually testing your trading strategy on historical price data to see how it would have performed in the past. It is the bridge between having a theoretical idea and having a proven, reliable edge in the markets.</p>
                     <div class="example-box">
                       <p><strong>Analogy: The Flight Simulator.</strong> A pilot would never fly a real jumbo jet without first spending hundreds of hours in a flight simulator. Backtesting is your flight simulator. It's where you build your skills and prove your strategy works without any real-world financial risk.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Why Backtesting is Non-Negotiable</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>It Builds Statistical Confidence:</strong> After backtesting, you will know your strategy's historical win rate and profitability. You will be trading based on data, not hope.</li>
                        <li><strong>It Builds Muscle Memory:</strong> You will train your eyes to spot your specific trade setup quickly and accurately.</li>
                        <li><strong>It Builds Psychological Resilience:</strong> You will see firsthand that your strategy has losing trades. When this happens in the live market, you won't panic, because you've already proven the strategy is profitable in the long run.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How to Backtest: A Practical Guide</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Get Your Tools:</strong> You need your written Trading Plan, your Trading Journal, and a chart on TradingView.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use the "Bar Replay" Feature:</strong> On TradingView, there is a tool called "Bar Replay" at the top of the screen. This allows you to go back in time on any chart and then move the price forward one candle at a time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Follow Your Plan:</strong> Go back 6-12 months in the data, hide the future price action, and then move forward candle by candle, looking for your trade setup based on your checklist.</li>
                        <li><strong>Log Every Trade:</strong> When you see a valid setup, pause and log the trade in your journal—entry, stop loss, take profit, and the final outcome (win or loss)—just as if it were a real trade. Be honest.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The goal is to collect a large sample size of trades, ideally <strong>50-100 trades</strong> per currency pair, to get reliable statistics on your strategy's performance.</p>
