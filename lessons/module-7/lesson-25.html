                    <h2>Introduction: The Final Step</h2>
                    <p>This is the moment every new trader works towards. You've learned the theory, you have a strategy, and you've practiced on a demo account. Making the leap to trading with real money is a huge step, and doing it correctly is vital for your long-term success.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The "Are You Ready?" Checklist</h2>
                    <p>Before you even think about depositing real money, you must be able to honestly answer <strong>"YES"</strong> to every single one of these questions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have you backtested your strategy and logged at least 50-100 trades?</li>
                        <li>Have you been <strong>consistently profitable on a demo account</strong> for at least one to two months?</li>
                        <li>Do you have a <strong>written Trading Plan</strong> with clear rules?</li>
                        <li>Have you been following that plan with <strong>100% discipline</strong> on your demo account?</li>
                        <li>Have you set aside trading capital that you are genuinely and financially <strong>prepared to lose</strong>?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>The Biggest Challenge: The Psychological Shift</h3>
                    <p>The charts, the platform, and your strategy are all exactly the same. But one thing changes dramatically when you go live: the <strong>emotion</strong>.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                       <p><strong>Analogy: Video Game vs. Real Life.</strong> Trading on a demo account is like playing a high-stakes video game. It's exciting, but you know the points aren't real. Trading with a live account is like playing the exact same game, but with your real rent money on the line. The game hasn't changed, but the <em>feeling</em> is completely different.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>How to Make the Transition Safely</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Start Incredibly Small.</strong> Do not jump in with your full trading capital. Start with the smallest possible account size and the smallest possible lot size (0.01 lots).</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on Process, Not Profit.</strong> For your first month of live trading, your only goal is to execute your trading plan perfectly. Do not focus on your profit or loss.</li>
                        <li><strong>Survive and Adapt.</strong> The first few months are about getting used to the psychology of having real money at risk. Focus on capital preservation and executing your plan.</li>
                    </ul>
