                <div class="explanation-box">
                    <p><b>Displacement</b> refers to a strong, aggressive, and efficient movement in price after an Order Block has been initiated or liquidity has been swept. It's characterized by large-bodied candles that move swiftly away from a key area, often leaving Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) behind.</p>
                    <p>Displacement is crucial because it acts as a <b>confirmation</b> of institutional involvement. When you see price displace strongly after interacting with an Order Block or sweeping liquidity, it signals that Smart Money has entered the market with conviction, pushing price in their intended direction. This validates the Order Block and any resulting FVG.</p>
                    <div class="analogy-card">
                        <p><span class="accent">Imagine a rock thrown into water:</span> The initial splash is the order block or liquidity sweep. The ripples quickly spreading outwards are the displacement, showing the force behind the action.</p>

                    <div class="warning-note">
                        <p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Without displacement, an Order Block or FVG has less significance. Look for this strong move to confirm the institutional footprint.</p>

                <div class="explanation-box">
                    <p>A <b>Mitigation Block</b> is a type of Order Block that was initially expected to hold as support or resistance, but price traded right through it without fully mitigating the institutional orders within. When price later returns to this broken Order Block, it's returning to "mitigate" or fill those remaining, previously unfilled orders before continuing its move.</p>
                    <p>Essentially, it's a failed Order Block (from one perspective) that becomes a significant point of interest (POI) for a re-entry or continuation trade from the institutional perspective. Institutions use these areas to balance their books.</p>

                            <p>Price is in an uptrend, hits a bearish OB, but instead of reversing, it blasts through it (due to overwhelming bullish pressure). Later, price pulls back to this now "broken" bearish OB. This area acts as support for a continuation of the bullish trend.</p>

                        <div class="concept-card">
                            <h4><i class="fas fa-share-square"></i> Trading with Mitigation Blocks</h4>
                            <p>Once a valid OB is broken with displacement, anticipate a return to that original OB (now a Mitigation Block) for a potential entry in the direction of the new trend.</p>

                <div class="explanation-box">
                    <p>A <b>Breaker Block</b> is a more specific type of POI linked to a failed swing point in market structure. It forms when a swing high (in an uptrend) or swing low (in a downtrend) fails to create a new Break of Structure (BOS), and then gets decisively broken itself by price with displacement.</p>
                    <p>The original swing point that failed to extend the trend, once broken, often acts as a strong reversal or continuation point when price returns to retest it. Institutions use these areas to reverse positions or re-enter trades.</p>

                            <p>Price is in an uptrend, makes a Higher High (HH), then a Higher Low (HL). If this HL then breaks the previous HL and makes a new low, the <b>old HL that failed to make a new HH</b> becomes your Breaker Block, acting as resistance.</p>

                <div class="explanation-box">
                    <p>Understanding <b>Premium and Discount Zones</b> is fundamental to identifying optimal entry points. Institutions are always looking to buy at a discount and sell at a premium. These zones are derived from a specific "dealing range" – typically the most recent swing high to swing low that defines a structural leg.</p>
                    <ul class="premium-discount-list">
                        <li><i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i> <p><b>Equilibrium:</b> The 50% midpoint of a dealing range.</p></li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-up"></i> <p><b>Premium Zone:</b> The area <b>above</b> equilibrium (above 50% of the range). This is where Smart Money looks to <b>sell</b>.</p></li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-down"></i> <p><b>Discount Zone:</b> The area <b>below</b> equilibrium (below 50% of the range). This is where Smart Money looks to <b>buy</b>.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To identify these zones, you draw a Fibonacci Retracement tool from the low to the high of the relevant dealing range (for buys) or high to the low (for sells). The 50% level is your equilibrium.</p>
                    <div class="real-world-example">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> Practical Application:</h4>
                        <p>If you're looking for a long (buy) opportunity, you want price to retrace into a <b>Discount Zone</b>, ideally interacting with an Order Block or FVG there. If you're looking for a short (sell) opportunity, you want price to retrace into a <b>Premium Zone</b>, interacting with an institutional footprint there.</p>
                        <p> *(Add image/chart example showing a dealing range with 50%, premium, and discount zones marked.)* </p>

                    <p>1. On your charts, review instances of clear BOS or ChoCH.</p>
                    <p>2. After a BOS/ChoCH, identify if there was strong <b>Displacement</b>. Does it leave FVGs?</p>
                    <p>3. Look for instances where an Order Block was violated, and then price returned to that broken OB (now a <b>Mitigation Block</b>).</p>
                    <p>4. Try to identify failed swings that turn into <b>Breaker Blocks</b>.</p>
                    <p>5. Pick a recent swing leg (high to low, or low to high). Draw your Fibonacci and identify the <b>Premium and Discount Zones</b>. Observe how price reacts in these areas.</p>
