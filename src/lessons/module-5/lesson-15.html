                    <h2>Introduction: The Skill That Keeps You in the Game</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the most important lesson you will ever learn in your trading career. The single skill that separates consistently profitable traders from the 90% who fail is <strong>risk management</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Trading is not about predicting the future; it is about managing uncertainty. Your first job as a trader is not to make money; it's to <strong>protect the money you already have</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>The 1-2% Rule: Your Unbreakable Foundation</h2>
                    <p>The cornerstone of all risk management is a simple but powerful rule: <strong>Never risk more than 1% to 2% of your total account balance on any single trade.</strong></p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Why it's so important:</strong> This rule guarantees your survival. If you only risk 2% per trade, you would have to lose <strong>50 trades in a row</strong> to wipe out your account. This keeps you in the game long enough to learn, adapt, and become profitable.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vivid Example:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Trader A (Professional)</strong> has a $1,000 account and follows the 2% rule. Their maximum loss on any trade is <strong>$20</strong>. If they lose 5 trades in a row, they've lost $100 and can easily continue trading tomorrow.</li>
                            <li><strong>Trader B (Gambler)</strong> has a $1,000 account and risks 20%. If they are wrong just 5 times in a row, their account is completely gone.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Risk-to-Reward Ratio (R:R): Trading Smart</h2>
                    <p>The second pillar of risk management is ensuring your potential profits are significantly larger than your potential losses. This is called the Risk-to-Reward Ratio.</p>
                    <p>A good R:R means you don't have to be right all the time to be profitable.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>Vivid Example:</strong> If you risk $20 (your stop loss) to make $40 (your take profit), your risk-to-reward ratio is <strong>1:2</strong>. This means that even if you are only right half the time, you will still be very profitable over the long run.</p>
