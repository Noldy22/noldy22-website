                    <h2>Introduction: The Final Battle is Within</h2>
                    <p>You can have the best trading strategy in the world and perfect risk management, but if you cannot control your own mind, you will not succeed. The financial market is an arena of emotion, and the final battle for a trader is not against the market, but against themselves. Trading psychology is the skill of managing your emotions so you can execute your plan flawlessly.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Two Primal Emotions: Greed and Fear</h2>
                    <p>All bad trading decisions are driven by two powerful emotions. Learning to recognize them is the first step to controlling them.</p>

                    <h3>1. Greed</h3>
                    <p>Greed is the intense desire for unrealistic profits on every single trade. It shows up when you hold a winning trade for too long, hoping it will turn into a lottery ticket, only to watch it reverse into a loss. It also shows up when you risk too much money on a single trade because you "feel" it's a sure thing.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Fear</h3>
                    <p>Fear is the paralyzing fear of losing money. It shows up when you close a good winning trade far too early, leaving massive profits on the table. It also shows up as "analysis paralysis"—being too afraid to enter a valid trade setup that meets all your rules.</p>

                    <h2>The Two Destructive Behaviors</h2>
                    <p>When you let greed and fear take control, they lead to two of the most destructive behaviors in trading.</p>
                     <div class="example-box">
                        <p><strong>FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out):</strong> You see a currency pair making a huge move without you. Greed and fear mix together, and you jump into the trade late, often right at the top just before it reverses. You were afraid of missing the move, so you abandoned your plan.</p>
                        <p><strong>Revenge Trading:</strong> You just took a loss. You feel angry and frustrated, and you want to "make your money back" from the market immediately. You jump into another unplanned, emotional trade, which almost always leads to an even bigger loss.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Solution: Building Unbreakable Discipline</h2>
                    <p>You cannot stop feeling greed or fear—they are human emotions. But you can learn to act in spite of them. The tool for this is <strong>discipline</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Think of discipline like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets. The only way to win the psychological game is to have a <strong>written trading plan</strong> with clear rules and the <strong>discipline to follow those rules no matter what</strong>. We will build this plan in the very next lesson.</p>
