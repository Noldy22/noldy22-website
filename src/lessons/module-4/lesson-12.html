                    <hr class="lesson-divider">

                    <h2>Introduction: The "Why" Behind Price Moves</h2>
                    <p>In the last module, we learned Technical Analysisâ€”the art of reading charts. That tells us <strong>what</strong> the price is doing and <strong>how</strong> it's moving. Fundamental Analysis (FA) is different. It's the study of a country's economic health to understand <strong>why</strong> its currency might get stronger or weaker.</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                       <p><strong>Analogy: Weather vs. Climate.</strong> If Technical Analysis is like reading a weather map to see where a storm is now, Fundamental Analysis is like studying the climate to understand why storms form in that region in the first place.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Core Idea: Strong Economy = Strong Currency</h2>
                    <p>The central idea of fundamental analysis is simple: a country with a healthy, growing economy will attract foreign investment. To invest in that country, foreign companies must first buy that country's currency. This increased demand causes the currency's value (its exchange rate) to rise.</p>

                    <h2>What are "The Fundamentals"?</h2>
                    <p>When traders talk about a country's fundamentals, they are looking at key pieces of economic data that signal its health. The most important ones are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> This is the single most important driver. A higher interest rate offers a better return for holding a currency, attracting investors and strengthening the currency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic Growth (GDP):</strong> Gross Domestic Product is the total value of all goods and services a country produces. A rising GDP indicates a strong, healthy economy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Employment Data:</strong> Low unemployment means people have jobs and are spending money, which signals a strong economy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inflation (CPI):</strong> The Consumer Price Index measures rising prices. High inflation can force a central bank to raise interest rates to control it.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Conclusion: Combining Fundamentals and Technicals</h2>
                    <p>Most professional traders use a blend of both. They use <strong>fundamental analysis</strong> to form a long-term directional bias (e.g., "The U.S. economy is strong, so I should be looking to buy the Dollar"). Then, they use <strong>technical analysis</strong> to find a precise, low-risk entry point for their trade.</p>
